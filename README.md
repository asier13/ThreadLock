ThreadLock is a dynamic ransomware developed in C/C++, designed to autonomously encrypt files on a victim's Linux system.
It leverages multithreading for optimized performance, supports file exclusion lists, and integrates with a Command and Control (C2) server to receive real-time encryption configurations, including algorithm selection and encryption keys. 
ThreadLock ensures a fast and adaptable encryption process, making it a sophisticated tool in the realm of cybersecurity.
